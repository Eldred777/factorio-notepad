# WHO WHAT WHEN WHERE WHY

Hi, I'm me. 

Factorio mod for an ingame note taker. 

Now.

Somewhere on the scale between the universe and your computer's pins. 

I kept bouncing off Factorio because I'd forget what I was doing so I hope doing this is both a way for me to learn some cool code stuff (never made a mod before!) and also get into Factorio once and for all. I imagine this kind of thing has been made already but I reckon this should be easy enough that I may as well reinvent the wheel.
